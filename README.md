# Weather-Forecast

IntelliJ- 2021 version
Java -11

IntelliJ IDEA (hereafter referred as IntelliJ) is one of the most powerful and popular Integrated Development Environments (IDE) for Java

Microservices with SpringBoot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.

Core technologies: dependency injection, events, resources, i18n, validation, data binding, type conversion, SpEL, AOP.

Testing: mock objects, TestContext framework, Spring MVC Test, WebTestClient.

Data Access: transactions, DAO support, JDBC, ORM, Marshalling XML.

Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux(MonoFlux) web frameworks.

Integration: remoting, JMS, JCA, JMX, email, tasks, scheduling, cache.

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

# Explanation

This assignment is about Web Client utilises own REST API service to retrieve weather information for given location.
Service should expose REST API and the response should show this information:

. Country
. City
. temp
. time 
Service should presents in metrics units

Example:

Country : Finland
City : Oulu
temp : -2
time : 11:30pm


Unit Testing:

Mockito is a popular mock framework which can be used in conjunction with JUnit. Mockito allows you to create and configure mock objects. Using Mockito simplifies the development of tests for classes with external dependencies significantly.

Testing part is also include but still work is yet to be completed.

By using Spring Boot, the work made little easier for developing Java Projects and learning is also interested to learn.
